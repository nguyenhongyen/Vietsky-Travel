											Booking Conditions
										</h2>
									</div>
									<div class="detailContent">
										<p>Steppes Travel Booking Terms &amp; Conditions and supplementary general
											information
										</p>
										<p>The following booking conditions, general information and the supplementary
											information, form the basis of your contract with Steppes Travel Ltd,
											trading as Steppes Travel, Steppes Discovery and The Traveller, ‘The
											Company’, ‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’. Steppes Travel Ltd, of 51 Castle Street,
											Cirencester, GL7 1QD, is registered in England under number 03307429. By
											making a booking, the first named person on the booking agrees on behalf of
											all persons detailed on the booking that:
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>He/she has read these terms and conditions and has the authority to and
												does agree to be bound by them;
											</li>
											<li>He/she consents to our use of information in accordance with our Privacy
												Policy detailed in paragraph 10.
											</li>
											<li>He/she is over 18 years of age and where placing an order for services
												with age restrictions declares that he/she and all members of the party
												are of the appropriate age to purchase those services.
											</li>
										</ol>
										<ol>
											<li><strong>Making your booking</strong><br>
												Please complete the booking form and forward it to The Company with a
												deposit of at least 30% of the total booking value. Where applicable an
												additional deposit payment may be required to cover any extra costs.
												Please note that if you are booking 12 weeks or less before departure
												then<br>
												full payment is required at the time of booking.Subject to availability,
												The Company will confirm acceptance of your booking by issuing a
												confirmation invoice. A binding contract comes into existence between
												you and The Company when a Confirmation Invoice is despatched to you or
												your Travel Agent. If the Company cannot accept your booking, any
												payment you have<br>
												made to The Company will be refunded. Special requests should be
												indicated on the Booking Form at the time of booking or made in writing
												to The Company as soon as possible. The Company will try to arrange for
												reasonable special requests to be met, but cannot guarantee that they
												will be, nor will failure to meet any<br>
												special request be a breach of contract on the Company’s part.Many
												airlines now require the full names of all passengers travelling. We
												will, therefore, ask you at the time of booking to confirm the number of
												members in your party and to provide us with the first forename, title
												and surname of each member (as shown on each passport). The information
												that is completed on the booking<br>
												form will be sent to Airlines, it is mandatory that we receive this
												information correctly; if not the Company cannot be held liable.
											</li>
											<li><strong>Airlines &amp; Other Suppliers</strong><br>
												Steppes Travel Ltd, act only as an agent for the airlines and suppliers
												of services. These suppliers provide these services in accordance with
												their own terms and conditions. Some of these terms and conditions may
												limit or exclude the supplier’s liability to you, usually in accordance
												with applicable International Conventions<br>
												(available upon request), and subject to the laws of the
												country.Excursions or other tours that you may choose to book or pay for
												whilst you are on holiday are not part of your package holiday provided
												by us. For any excursion or other tours that you book, your contract
												will be with the supplier of the excursion or tour and not with us. We
												are not responsible for the provision of the excursion or tour or for
												anything that happens during the course of its provision.If we, or the
												suppliers identified on your ATOL certificate, are unable to provide the
												services listed (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL
												holder or otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air
												Travel Trust may make a payment to (or confer a benefit on) you under
												the ATOL scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit
												you assign absolutely to those Trustees any claims which you have or may
												have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services,
												including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card
												issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may be
												reassigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you have
												claimed under the ATOL scheme.
											</li>
											<li><strong>Your responsibilities</strong>
												<ol>
													<li type="a">It is your responsibility to ensure that visas,
														passports, vaccination certificates and other health documents
														are in order before departure. Advice on health requirements may
														be obtained from your GP or alternatively please read the
														leaflet Advice on Health for Travellers which is available from
														the Dept of Health.
													</li>
													<li type="a">The Company is unable to accept responsibility for any
														decisions, actions, losses or delays in relation to any failure
														by you to obtain or carry the correct documentation and the
														consequential effect it may have on the visit itself, except
														where caused by the negligence of The Company or any of its
														employees or agents. The Company will not be liable for clients
														missing flights as a result of late check-ins, and no refunds
														will be given if you fail to take up any component of your
														arrangement.
													</li>
													<li type="a">If, in the reasonable opinion of The Company or of any
														other person in authority you or any member of your party
														behaves in such a manner as to cause or be likely to cause
														danger, distress or annoyance to others or damage to property,
														your (or the person’(s) concerned) arrangements may be
														terminated by The Company<br>
														or the supplier concerned. In such an event, you must pay any
														compensation or meet any costs or expenses which you and/or The
														Company incur as a result.
													</li>
													<li type="a">Travel insurance is mandatory on all of our trips. We
														do offer insurance, details of which are found on our website.
														Should you choose to arrange your own insurance we will require
														you to let us have evidence of your insurance at least 8 weeks
														prior to departure or at the time of booking if later. We
														reserve the right to terminate your booking if you fail to
														obtain travel insurance cover. Particular care should be taken
														to ensure that you have adequate cover, in particular for
														cancellation and emergency repatriation in the event of medical
														problems.
													</li>
												</ol>
											</li>
											<li><strong>The responsibilities of the Company</strong>
												<ol>
													<li type="a">Please note, in comparison with more conventional
														locations, the destinations you choose (which may include very
														remote areas) may not achieve the level of sophistication and
														development that might normally be expected. Facilities in some
														areas will be found to be of a basic nature and more appropriate
														to the local<br>
														culture than foreign tourists.
													</li>
													<li type="a">Subject to these Booking Terms &amp; Conditions, if we

													</li>
													<li type="a">The Company’s acceptance of liability in this clause is

													</li>
													<li type="a">If booking your own flights, or transportation, we
														strongly advise you to only book fully flexible fares, which can
														be can be cancelled or changed without charge prior to

														include war, or threat of war, riot, civil strife, actual or

													</li>
												</ol>
											</li>
											<li><strong>Price Policy</strong>
												<ol>
													<li type="a">After a confirmation invoice has been issued, the price
														of your arrangements is still subject to the possibility of
														surcharges in certain limited circumstances. However, subject to
														the correction of errors, a surcharge will only be levied to
														reflect increases in transportation costs (including fuel and
														scheduled airfares), dues, taxes (including a change in either
														foreign or UK VAT), fees chargeable for services (such as
														landing taxes and embarkation or disembarkation fees at ports or
														airports), or adverse variations in exchange rates which have
														been used to calculate the price of your arrangements.
														Surcharges will be notified by a Supplementary Invoice sent to
														you (or your travel agent).
													</li>
													<li type="a">The Company undertakes however, not to levy a surcharge
														within 10 weeks (70 days) of departure except in the
														circumstances set out in (a) above and:
													</li>
													<li type="a">Even when our costs increase as set out in 5. (a)
														above, the Company will absorb a total equivalent to 2% of the
														cost of your confirmed arrangements (excluding insurance
														premiums and amendment charges). Only if the increased costs
														exceed this 2% will The Company levy a surcharge. If a surcharge
														made would increase the<br>
														total price of your arrangements (excluding insurance premiums
														and amendment charges) by 10% or more, you may cancel your
														booking within 14 days of the date of issue of the supplementary
														invoice and obtain a full refund of all payments made to The
														Company, except for insurance premiums and any amendment charges
														previously incurred.
													</li>
													<li type="a">The financial commitments made above by The Company in
														respect of the booking means that no refunds<br>
														can be made in the event of exchange rate fluctuations or
														decreases in cost.
													</li>
													<li type="a">Please note, changes and errors occasionally occur. You
														must check the price of your chosen arrangements at the time of
														booking.
													</li>
												</ol>
											</li>
											<li><strong>Amendments &amp; Cancellation</strong>
												<ol>
													<li type="a">Amendments by you While the Company will make every
														effort to assist you if you wish to alter your arrangements it
														cannot guarantee it will be able to meet such requests. Requests
														for an amendment must be in writing and signed by the signatory
														of the Booking Form. In the event of an amendment all
														communication<br>
														charges and other expenses and all costs and charges incurred or
														imposed by any of our suppliers will be payable by you together
														with an amendment fee of £50 per amendment. If you change your
														booking less than 10 weeks before departure, this will be
														treated as a cancellation by you and a re-booking, and the
														normal cancellation charges detailed in paragraph 6 (b) below
														will apply.
													</li>
													<li type="a">Cancellation by you Should you or another member of
														your party need to cancel your arrangements, you must tell us in
														writing.<br>
														Your notice of cancellation will only be effective when it is
														received in writing at our offices. As we incur costs from the
														time we confirm your booking the following cancellation charges
														will be payable. Where the cancellation charge is shown as a
														percentage, this is calculated on the total cost payable by the
														person (s)<br>
														cancelling excluding insurance premiums and amendment charges
														(which are non-refundable). Period before departure from when
														written notification is received by us: Cancellation charge per
														person<br>
														cancelling:<br>
														141 days or more full deposit<br>
														85 days – 140 days 50%<br>
														84 days or less 100% charge Note: Certain arrangements (such as
														scheduled flights) could incur a cancellation charge of up to
														100% of that<br>
														part of the arrangements in addition to the charges above.<br>
														Insurance premiums and amendment charges are non-refundable. If
														your cancellation falls within the provisions of your travel
														insurance policy, you may be able to make a claim which must be
														made direct to your insurance company.
													</li>
												</ol>
											</li>
											<li><strong>Amendments and Cancellations by The Company before
												departure.</strong><br>
												We take great care to provide the tour arrangements that have been
												confirmed, but we must retain the right to modify or cancel any tour,
												flight schedule, accommodation or arrangement. Most changes are minor.
												Occasionally we have to make a ‘significant change’. ‘Significant
												changes’ in these booking conditions include<br>
												the following changes when made before departure; – a change of flight
												time by more than 8 hours, a change of international airport (except
												between airports serving the same city), a change of destination or a
												change to a lower official classification or standard of accommodation
												for the whole or a major part of the time you are<br>
												away. Note: Any change in the identity of the carrier (s), flight
												timings, and/or aircraft type is deemed to be a minor change.<br>
												In such circumstance, we will inform you as soon as possible. Should the
												change be such that it significantly alters the nature of the tour (as
												defined above), we shall give you the choice of an alternative tour or a
												full refund of all money paid. In recognition we will absorb all
												financial loss consequent upon cancellation. We<br>
												shall not cancel any tour for reason of political tension or natural
												disaster unless specifically recommended to do so by the Foreign Office.
											</li>
											<li><strong>Group tours and cancellations</strong><br>
												There may be circumstances beyond our control where the tour expert is
												no longer available. We will do all we can to find a suitable
												replacement, but in certain instances this may not be possible. The
												prices of group tours are based on a varying minimum number of
												passengers travelling. If this minimum number is not reached, at least
												12 weeks prior to the scheduled departure date we will either cancel the
												tour and offer a refund in full, or we may propose a supplementary
												charge to enable said tour to operate, subject to passenger’s agreement.
											</li>
											<li><strong>Complaints</strong><br>
												If you are unhappy with a service or facility provided in connection
												with your arrangements, you should address your complaint immediately to
												The Company’s local representative and, if relevant, to the management
												of the hotel or other supplier whose services are involved, so that The
												Company will have an opportunity to correct the matter whilst you are
												away.<br>
												If the problem cannot be solved locally however, you must write to us
												within 28 days of your return to the UK giving your booking information
												and full details of your complaint. If you fail to follow this simple
												procedure we will have been deprived of the opportunity to investigate
												and rectify your complaint promptly and this may<br>
												affect your rights under this contract.<br>
												These Booking Terms &amp; Conditions and any agreement to which they
												apply are governed in all respects by English law. We both agree that
												any dispute, claim or other matter which arises between us out of or in
												connection with your contract or booking will be dealt with by the
												Courts which lie within the United Kingdom.
											</li>
											<li><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br>
												The process of booking your holiday requires that we use the personal
												data you provide such as your name and address. In addition, we may need
												some sensitive personal data such as special needs or dietary
												preferences etc. This information is passed on to the airlines and
												hotels and any other suppliers of your travel arrangements on a ‘need to
												know’ basis. If we cannot pass this information to the relevant
												suppliers, we cannot accept your booking. In making a booking, you
												consent to this information being passed on to the relevant persons. The
												information may also be provided to public authorities, as required by
												law. You should also be aware that controls on data protection in many
												of the countries we deal with are not as strong as in the UK. We will
												however not pass your information on to any person not responsible for
												part of your travel arrangements unless required to do so by law. Full
												details of our data protection policy are available upon request.

										<h3>Flexible Payment Terms</h3>
										<p>There is still much uncertainty regarding coronavirus and its impact on
											travel. While some countries are opening their borders and in-country
											services are beginning to resume, the situation around the world remains
											fluid. To accommodate this uncertainty, Steppes Travel is offering flexible
											payment terms to all its clients looking to make new bookings. A
											one-size-fits-all approach is just not practical and so your travel
											consultant will negotiate with our partners on the ground, to give you the
											most flexible rates and payment terms possible. This will mean reduced
											deposit amounts and a final payment date later than normal. We will work
											closely with our friends and partners on the ground, to ensure your
											financial exposure is kept to a minimum.

												<li>Accommodation</li>
												<li>Guiding</li>
												<li>Visiting public places</li>
											</ul>
											<p>It is important that we help you prepare for your trip. We will let you

												distancing and the wearing of masks and gloves. If there is anything you
												are unsure of then please just ask.
											</p>
											<p>We do not claim to have all the answers but at all times will work with

											Financial Protection
										</h2>
									</div>
									<div class="detailContent">
										<p>We understand how important it is for you, our client, to have peace of mind
											and know that your monies are properly protected.
										</p>
										<p>Your money is 100% protected – i.e. in the unlikely event that we were to
											cease trading, you would get your monies back – either by the ATOL scheme or
											through The Association of Bonded Travel Organisers Trust Limited (ABTOT).
										</p>
										<p>When you book a ‘package’ which includes flights and ground arrangements
											(such as hotels, transfers and excursions in combination), if you are in the
											UK at the time of making your booking your arrangements will be covered
											under the ATOL scheme, unless the first leg of your journey as booked by us
											originates in the Irish Republic. You will also be covered for such
											arrangements if you are outside the UK at the time of making the booking but
											the first leg of your travel as booked by us originates in the UK.
										</p>
										<p>When you book a package that includes a combination of ground arrangements
											but does not include a flight, the money you pay us for those arrangements,
											and the costs of your repatriation will be covered by ABTOT.
										</p>
										<p><strong>The Association of Bonded Travel Organisers Trust Limited

										<p>ABTOT provides financial protection under The Package Travel and Linked

										<h3>ATOL</h3>
										<p>ATOL stands for the Air Travel Organisers Licence and is administered the
											Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). It is a legal requirement for us, Steppes
											Travel, to report all qualifying bookings to the CAA and to pay a fee for
											each qualifying passenger into the Air Travel Trust. In the event that we
											ceased trading whilst you were abroad on your holiday, the Air Travel Trust
											is the fund used to repatriate you and ensure you are not left stranded. If
											we were to cease trading prior to your holiday, the CAA guarantees all
											monies paid to us for your holiday and would refund it to you.
										</p>
										<p>It is worth noting that in order to be granted an ATOL licence by the CAA, we
											are obliged to submit our accounts to the CAA for their scrutiny on a
											regular basis. The CAA looks for a strong balance sheet in order to satisfy
											themselves that Steppes Travel is a solvent going concern. This financial
											scrutiny should be a source of reassurance for all of you, our clients, not
											just those falling under ATOL protection.
										</p>
										<p>The CAA provide us with standard text to state on all our collateral, and
											this reads: “All the flights and flight-inclusive holidays on this website
											are financially protected by the ATOL scheme. When you pay you will be
											supplied with an ATOL Certificate. Please ask for it and check to ensure
											that everything you booked (flights, hotels and other services) is listed on
											it. Please see our booking conditions for further information or for more
											information about financial protection and the ATOL Certificate go to:
											www.atol.org.uk/ ATOLCertificate”.
										</p>
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<h3>Further protection for our clients – Package Travel Trust</h3>
										<p>From 2021, Steppes Travel ATOL funds are placed securely with a third party
											trustee (PT Trustees) until our clients return safely return from their
											travels. <a href="https://pttrustees.com/">PT Trustees</a> have been
											approved by the CAA to operate a trust on our behalf and have a long
											standing track record in the travel sector managing over £1bn of trust fund
											annually for a large number of businesses. By using the trust this we can
											ensure that there are always funds to pay suppliers or to refund clients
											should we not be able to operate a holiday for any reason.
										</p>
										<p>Please note that this is not a substitute for travel insurance and we advise
											clients to arrange their own travel insurance as soon as they book a trip to
											ensure they are fully covered if they have any personal reasons preventing
											them from travelling.
										</p>

										<h3>Travel Regulation Insolvency Protection</h3>
										<p class="x_MsoNormal">Steppes Travel Ltd is a company committed to customer
											satisfaction and consumer financial protection. We are therefore pleased to
											announce that, at no extra cost to you, and in accordance with “The Package
											Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018” all passengers
											booking with Steppes Travel Ltd are fully insured for the initial deposit,
